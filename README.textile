h2. Hoptoad Cleaner

A simple "Resolve All" script for Hoptoad.  

h3. Installation

* Update 'cleaner.rb' with your Hoptoad API key and subdomain.  
* Then run:
** gem install 'rest-client'
** gem install 'crack'
** ruby ./cleaner.rb

h3. More info:

This code was largely inspired by 'Stoptoad': http://github.com/gordonbisnor/Stoptoad

However, I was hesitant to use an untrusted web service with my API key, so I converted it to a script.
